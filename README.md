# Rising-Waters
A Machine Learning Approach to Flood Prediction
Rising-Waters is a machine learning-driven project that forecasts potential flood events by analysing historical weather patterns, cloud cover and annual rainfall. The project aims to provide timely alerts and actionable insights to minimise flood impacts on life and infrastructure.


## Features

- Predicts flood occurrence using multiple ML models
- Compares model performance and selects the most accurate
- Flask-based web application for live predictions
