# Rising Waters – Flood Risk Classifier

_A machine learning-powered web app for classifying flood risk based on rainfall patterns_

---

## 📌 Overview

**Rising Waters** is a machine learning project designed to predict flood risk levels based on rainfall and weather distribution patterns. It uses a **Logistic Regression model** to classify user input into **Low**, **Mid**, or **High** flood risk categories, displayed through a clean and simple **Flask web interface**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Due to project constraints, the model was trained on a **very small dataset (only 115 records)**. Complex models like XGBoost were found to **overfit**, and were replaced with **Logistic Regression** for more generalizable predictions.
